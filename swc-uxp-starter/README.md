# **UXP Plugin with Spectrum Web Component**
Since UXP v7.2
# **Objective**
This sample will help you to create a Spectrum Web Component (SWC) based UXP plugin. It includes setting up the project, integrating the SWC components, and mounting it over the host applications - Photoshop and XD.

Check out the [UXP docs](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc) and read more about Adobe [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/index.html).


# **Getting started**
1. Start by installing the dependencies `yarn install`
2. Prepare the bundle using Webpack `yarn build`. You will notice a **dist** folder after this step.
3. Load the plugin in Photoshop (minimum Version v24.4) or XD (version TBD) by launching the app. Add the plugin in the UDT by selecting `manifest.json`. Click on the plugin action menu in UDT, select More > Advanced and enter the relative location for the plugin builder folder (`./dist` is this case).

You should be able to see a banner in Photoshop plugin.

# **Add a new component**
You can use any of the supported components listed in [our docs](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc) by following these steps:
1. Use `yarn add` to install the components and its supported version.

```javascript
yarn add @swc-uxp-wrappers/link@1.0.0;
```

**Note:** The ```@swc-uxp-wrappers``` components are intenally dependant on specific recomended versions of ```@spectrum-web-components```. Make sure to add these recommended version under the resolutions block in ```package.json``` too.

2. Import the component in `index.js` file. This has two approaches:

   a. Import directy via `@swc-uxp-wrappers`
   ```javascript
   import "@swc-uxp-wrappers/link/sp-link.js";
   ```
   b. Import via `@spectrum-web-components` and use aliasing in the webpack.conf.js file
   ```javascript
   import '@spectrum-web-components/link/sp-link.js';
   ```
   We are using aliasing to map these components (`@swc-uxp-wrappers` to `@spectrum-web-components` in webpack.conf.js as described in Deep Dive section). This approach makes the plugin cross-platform compatible i.e we can remove the aliasing and use the same plugin on Web.

3. Add the component in the html file.

```html
This is an <sp-link href="#">example link</sp-link>.
```

4. Run `yarn build` to prepare the distribution bundle.
You can also use `yarn watch` to create the bundle as soon as you save your changes to any source files. Use this along with Plugin -> Watch option in UDT to sync with latest changes automatically.

# **Deep dive**
Now that the plugin is working, we can look into the details.

### **webpack.config.js**

Webpack is used to bundle the dependencies in the project therefore you would see the webpack.config.js file for basic config.

Note that we have installed the `@swc-uxp-wrappers/utils` package in the package.json file and are using it to provide [aliasing](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) via mapping. We can remove this aliasing and use the same plugin on web too.

```
       resolve: {
            extensions: ['.js', '.json'],
            alias: aliases,

        }
```

Pro tip: For debugging purposes, add `eval-cheap-source-map` in the webpack.config file to get the source map in UDT debug window.

```javascript
devtool: 'eval-cheap-source-map'
```

### **package.json**

Once you install the component (using `yarn add`) you should see the components added to the 'dependencies'.

Also, in order to resolve transitive dependencies we need to [force resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/). TherebyÂ to avoid incompatibility issues in sub components, one needs to mention all the dependencies in the `resolutions` block too.

### **manifest.json**

Enable SWC by setting the **enableSWCSupport flag** to true.

```
"featureFlags": {
   "enableSWCSupport": true
}
```

### **src/index.html**
Includes index.js.

Observe that the SWC components are wrapped with a ```<sp-theme>``` element. This ensures that the Spectrum design tokens are delivered to the scoped HTML context.


### **src/index.js**
Import the components and themes to deliver the right styling to the components.
```javascript
//sp-theme
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/sp-theme.js';
//themes to use classic and spectrum themes
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/themes.js';
import '@spectrum-web-components/theme/src/express/themes.js';
```


# **Troubleshooting**

 If you see the following error in the console, these are some steps to resolve it.

```
Failed to execute 'define' on 'CustomElementRegistry': the name "sp-icon-alert" has already been used with this registry
```

Such errors occur when the package manager has resolved more than one copy of the component (sp-icon-alert in this case. Some of the ways to troubleshoot are:

* Make sure you dont have multiple calls to `index.js` somehow.
* Check if you have added the component in the resolutions block in package.json.
* Check if you are using correct recommended version of the package without the `^`.
