# Starter Photoshop Plugin (Vanilla)

This sample plugin creates a text layer in the active document and adds text to it. The text can come from an input field in the plugin panel, or from a file.

## Loading in Photoshop

You can load this plugin directly in Photoshop by using the UXP Developer Tools application. Once started, click "Add Plugin...", and navigate to the "manifest.json" file in this folder. Then click the ••• button next to the corresponding entry in the developer tools and click "Load". Switch over to Photoshop, and the plugin's panel will be running.
